"Design Thinking: A Guide to Creative Problem Solving for Everyone","Andrew Pressman","131720283X","2018-10-25","Routledge","154","<p>Design thinking is a powerful process that facilitates understanding and framing of problems, enables creative solutions, and may provide fresh perspectives on our physical and social landscapes. Not just for architects or product developers, design thinking can be applied across many disciplines to solve real-world problems and reconcile dilemmas. It is a tool that may trigger inspiration and the imagination, and lead to innovative ideas that are responsive to the needs and issues of stakeholders.</p><i> <p>Design Thinking: A Guide to Creative Problem Solving for Everyone</i> will assist in addressing a full spectrum of challenges from the most vexing to the everyday.

This book favors engineering principles over a 'recipe' approach to give you the skills you need to design and build your own projects. You'll understand the fundamental principles in a way that transfers to any type of electronics, electronic modules, or external peripherals, using a ""learning by doing"" approach that caters to both beginners and experts. The book begins with basic Linux and programming skills, and helps you stock your inventory with common parts and supplies. Next, you'll learn how to make parts work together to achieve the goals of your project, no matter what type of components you use. The companion website provides a full repository that structures all of the code and scripts, along with links to video tutorials and supplementary content that takes you deeper into your project. <p>The Raspberry Pi's most famous feature is its adaptability. It can be used for thousands of electronic applications, and using the Linux OS expands the functionality even more. This book helps you get the most from your Raspberry Pi, but it also gives you the fundamental engineering skills you need to incorporate any electronics into any project. <ul> <li>Develop the Linux and programming skills you need to build basic applications</li> <li>Build your inventory of parts so you can always ""make it work""</li> <li>Understand interfacing, controlling, and communicating with almost any component</li> <li>Explore advanced applications with video, audio, real-world interactions, and more</li> </ul> <p>Be free to adapt and create with <i>Exploring Raspberry Pi.</i>","Computers / Hardware / General","Technology & Engineering / General","","","","","","","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iftUDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72yu2YEUJ4kGFTrtfsckTC2avRpRvBoSp-oZ1BXhNQU0MDH2moiGiJnlmlFs_sHV4ELnIsjI3dKfZ1jgeuBI8UJ9RAE-PM90VIG4IUaBUCLWSHQo6dQD5lTGMG1juF-_gjHCQDm&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iftUDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE725UXRyhS75pcINiXKE_I9w1xMRfWpnru5krhrXB0Cez4-Dy7l0_qpX2Nek4taygVHv_g3EsiLA9HSjJC8fHku81GuSNMDcNtnRltRHFu5r-dVUtHHduFjwtXA3MuLEkpeB42LQ&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iftUDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71sVsMUC8t64xddw3o9VGlyvUPPhyLKIhlFVeEkR8nqwUkCt6cbnl1kTuQ1Cx784fmFDjJDgusF4AW5Jgeq244LkN-CCTg7Lm-JVkZWm7wdN-tjEuHImkZaHkLMPhW1MUWWLjKN&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iftUDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE737GMNUr_z4IBW4M4ZM_ZjOwEoL3wprBQF3wgC6C2tjajF7OBq9mW6s1hcSxb7flmEkgXygV5a_WsNrDlZyi5AzEbErbUhuVL0ZjnbUXOq52Hgakb3_tXGy7ay5Q2u63BIiSD5J&source=gbs_api","","","","","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iftUDAAAQBAJ","iftUDAAAQBAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Laser Cutting and 3-D Printing for Railway Modellers","Bob Gledhill","1785002279","2016-11-30","The Crowood Press","300","Although most people have heard of laser-cut and 3-D printed model railway parts and kits, most modellers have little knowledge or experience of them. This fascinating and well-illustrated book describes in non-technical language how these machines work and how railway modellers can use them to produce remarkable models for their layouts. With reference to the different modelling scales, the author discusses in detail the advantages and disadvantages of different types of machines, and the materials they employ. He also shows how beginners can install and use 'Sketchup Make', a free CAD (Computer Aided Design) program from the Internet. With step-by-step instructions and accompanying photographs, the author takes the modeller through the early stages of using this program before providing many examples of how to design model railway related items such as laser-cut roofing tiles, palisade fencing, brickwork, and the detailed elements of station awning. In addition, he demonstrates how to create 3-D printed furniture, barrels, packing crates, guttering and down pipes, rivet heads, and a workman's hut.The CAD skills learnt whilst following the clear instructions on how to draw these examples will enable modellers to design their own model railway parts, which can either be produced on their own machines or be sent away to be created by one of the many 'bureau' companies. Clear step-by-step instructions are given along with over 430 superb colour images.","Crafts & Hobbies / Model Railroading","","","","","","","","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CVZwDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70Wknd8pXr2bmZxP6j-PfZuUYd_czV3MVzPT8qKtVVTfxIN5w_-3fqR_25KjvsLF4bhys8_cr427XmQa1wfv0EcW86-dMD5thCxl5v_EFUD7sVRZTBtzZVJqu3R1w8hXhh6bhBc&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CVZwDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72_ri66m_irliwpJkFVPMJSpmHv0Ph3H_7dWFX2C960NCNxH7eYBV05mIP6xvj4Iz80Dkdvt63aR5QHUvb4mGnycXohOgIyt5Vxvj4ID7mX7DHn3T77teIED-uQpkRAexwfv9dg&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CVZwDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71KMCyqX9_wg2Aa7AadfCjI4pklYZx4PaYZIcg_aqP6bqeQq2RhcSLFGNPJy_VM7k7eZ3OOg2PMYksUa4glcf_DG1Y6gAlJq0BM1ywCpr_lJAQ3TJSNaaP4z933Ci9yknEjaeZp&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CVZwDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE701y-_b5fwIxlpqXGfBMBdBox4e9zoXejySd_rQIYLhPtVTQWJEd4bsIwQqa_IkHCfz0KrdRg6SrnmJRC9au4ARUNeWMSDYF7mHGzOq1T65MKvaXf64KTGF_vIVRWdi2mfeT6Sa&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CVZwDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72Cx1kP8KuDK-pAFRQenykO6GH6N-ygX9yUbb2h47qNJU_IFtGPko2l3sCBe-xfw5kSSjHiIh2AaaJ79Fx6tdV6hRWfz_YQhQYXPNv_u-IP9dGhf0BSjK1s-wC-ayGf3y0RqimO&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CVZwDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71eBvnt5naEn2TKEUQ3_A59Q7zo7VfB7Hz2dMHdtDxVUuw0EA3qLSgZYIql8NTHNTZQ76nvFg20sgu54Q074XA9G0cu8QOcHBvj-JBTElZonzXhkqgmhGslOB2Qyw9O__ayRQH4&source=gbs_api","","","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CVZwDQAAQBAJ","CVZwDQAAQBAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that's no fun for anyone.</p> <p><i>Python for Kids</i> brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R.

New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side.</p> <p>Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you'll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and &quot;Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit&quot;—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more.</p> <p>As you strike out on your programming adventure, you'll learn how to:</p><p>* Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps <br>* Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules <br>* Use control structures like loops and conditional statements <br>* Draw shapes and patterns with Python's turtle module <br>* Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter  </p><p>Why should serious adults have all the fun? <i>Python for Kids</i> is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming.</p>","Juvenile Nonfiction / Computers / Programming","Juvenile Nonfiction / General","","","","","","","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pMEUG8oNBfkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73oyRNu2KOWRIQ618XULxlgwRy4FbppJ6XWwckald1Y3wSOIuSa35EIKHYW37VjUu8uaAuLO53FxdjLcy88lF_kQrJrGtGroW5V-mTvJyJPhucAO_imq6F2Fb8FSj9eBGwkJPJG&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pMEUG8oNBfkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70i8Fb6yxnrJ2_JRp7tFU75qn46hANxL_5C77uIGiSLAp0jvgvpPWYxeRrvWNQZqy3BEmERyzlVjQoPnwAu-hbSFupS2ByJlKZs8tUgFAJzUjlCyhY4ni4t8EqMP0K84fOvpTLd&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pMEUG8oNBfkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71BhM7_mdnxF0f_AiwNfu5CZ86wZeeErtcU7IHXNlyDD9f2ieUgDoRKYMv2WPWMa61F-S8YE7bM9m_7ELBCvXkcZTy07Xi6_B4KnD12xXAll_BAfydwGuQ3mScEB7IoXiKHI3MI&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pMEUG8oNBfkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72B3UnfcMbF4V7Kq9Bz80KokQho-lywY4pptU7SLqjG56aoYn6FAPDuEIL150q_8ScLAm2loq9324CBYvWv18pYGWpgshC0QXfnBa50008pEhtwlmNZTY1Yg8GKA0oeoVNaMF1I&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pMEUG8oNBfkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72SnxtRcMrQGPMHM7oj3luNy7BQFnAY6ccTX4quqv4UrT1HuVrW5a3Lr7XP8cVXmbs_QP7fwAfWyAvYU_eEAH38P06M-MZQfVmhMNhpynHVR8UIIZlD1FRiU2ArvZnSoLcLMY_o&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pMEUG8oNBfkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71l4XpVm01KUnXvh_zVg4C9-Q-0gx9JkxhIfsLYGGbykPoffnMn5q12EwPfF6jgAHDeke1xdcJSPQbnv957SbG5bV7C9Kib0D-yyZH_poQeoeCcOKem-exZELcNP73qAZc71Czi&source=gbs_api","","","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pMEUG8oNBfkC","pMEUG8oNBfkC","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"The Art of Photography: A Personal Approach to Artistic Expression","Bruce Barnbaum","1681982102","2017","Rocky Nook","408","This is an updated and newly revised edition of the classic book The Art of Photography: An Approach to Personal Expression. Originally published in 1994 and first revised in 2010, The Art of Photography has sold well over 100,000 copies and has firmly established itself as the most readable, understandable, and complete textbook on photography. Featuring nearly 200 beautiful photographs in both black-and-white and color, as well as numerous charts, graphs, and tables, this book presents the world of photography to beginner, intermediate, and advanced photographers who seek to make a personal statement through the medium of photography.</p>Without talking down to anyone or talking over anyone's head, renowned photographer, teacher, and author Bruce Barnbaum presents how-to techniques for both traditional and digital approaches. In this newest edition of the book, Barnbaum has included many new images and has completely revised the text, with particular focus on two crucial chapters covering digital photography: he revised a chapter covering the digital zone system, and includes a brand-new chapter on image adjustments using digital tools. There is also a new chapter discussing the concepts of ""art versus technique"" and ""traditional versus digital"" approaches to photography. Throughout the book, Barnbaum goes well beyond the technical, as he delves deeply into the philosophical, expressive, and creative aspects of photography so often avoided in other books.</p>Barnbaum is recognized as one of the world's finest landscape and architectural photographers, and for decades has been considered one of the best instructors in the field of photography. This latest incarnation of his textbook--which has evolved, grown, and been refined over the past 45 years--will prove to be an ongoing, invaluable photographic reference for years to come. It is truly the resource of choice for the thinking photographer.</p>Topics include: </p> -Elements of Composition</p> -Visualization</p> -Light and Color</p> -Filters</p> -Black-and-White</p> -The Digital Zone System</p> -The Zone System for Film</p> -Printing and Presentation</p> -Exploding Photographic Myths</p> -Artistic Integrity</p> -Realism, Abstraction, and Art</p> -Creativity and Intuition</p> -A Personal Philosophy</p> -And much, much more...</p>","","","","","","","","","False","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RQ7VwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&imgtk=AFLRE72w4kO-ofF1oZ1TrMUkthQvBH-pTkvA30NiLgJ8c8n4YLbOREl5RaXpuax7L9gSExLI3GNcXk3JlcylbOj8ttffiMNbx2JriW2pYwSq_F5MJqcPyLRmEIu3pMfHzJ-T5sLUFydO&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RQ7VwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE72so0uk-66bfCpq4xlwULPrY6hHKfjSvi33YBqkQYHmz9tfYbv7SoaKwRCwT0I3lNmKc75rl0wvaqToHe_V_Dn98y_J_dO8JxyO0A_OVga729pKEjOKPITaN_oQ5-kIKGmhbxJF&source=gbs_api","","","","","","","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RQ7VwAEACAAJ","RQ7VwAEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"The Essential Guide to HTML5: Using Games to Learn HTML5 and JavaScript","Jeanine Meyer","1484241541","2018-11-06","Apress","417","HTML5 opens up a plethora of new avenues for application and game development on the web. Games can now be created and interacted with directly within HTML, with no need for users to download extra plugins, or for developers to learn new languages. Important new features such as the Canvas tag enable drawing directly onto the web page. The Audio tag allows sounds to be triggered and played from within your HTML code, the WebSockets API facilitates real-time communication, and the local storage API enables data such as high scores or game preferences to be kept on a user's computer for retrieval next time they play.
