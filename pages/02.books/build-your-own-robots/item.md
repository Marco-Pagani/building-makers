This book is perfect for a junior beginner to robotics who needs some fun projects to learn the basics.  It includes projects like a "Terminator Hand" made of straws and popsicle sticks, and  a "Tightrope Trickster" made of a cork and cardboard. The projects are made from household items and do require knowledge of coding or soldering.  There are plenty of pictures along with the step by step written instructions to follow.
