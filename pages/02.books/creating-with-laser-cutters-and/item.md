## Creating with Laser Cutters and Engravers
### By Mary-Lane Kamberg
This text provides readers with an exploratory lens into the general world of the Fab Lab with an in-depth focus on two specific types of machinery: laser cutters and engravers. These machines give users the unique opportunity to create through the removal of material from its source. Included for readers are hands-on tips and tricks for operating laser cutters and engravers, providing a variety of projects for every experience level, all the while connecting these skills to real-world business models and careers. This title tackles the arts and design element of STEAM more than any other Fab Lab machines do.
