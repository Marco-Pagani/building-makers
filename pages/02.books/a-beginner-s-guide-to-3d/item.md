The rise of enthusiast 3D printing and CNC machining has created a need for 3D CAD modelling skills, but CAD has traditionally been associated with a steep learning curve. With CAD for Beginners, you'll learn the basics of 3D CAD modelling all the way to advanced modelling using Autodesk Fusion 360, the cloud powered 3D CAD/CAM tool. In this practical guide, you'll start by learning the principles of parametric modelling and basic modelling and assembly methods. Then, you'll move into advanced modelling concepts like 3D sketching and splines, helixes and ribs, technical drawing, and rendering.
