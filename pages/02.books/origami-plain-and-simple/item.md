Have you ever had the urge to create a frog out of a plain sheet of paper? How about a sea serpent, an elephant, an angel fish, or even a chess set? With this fun and easy-to-use primer, you can make such origami animals and projects come magically to life. Renowned paperfolder Robert Neale and his coauthor, Thomas Hull, present thirty original models, perfect for absolute beginners as well as more seasoned paperfolders looking for fresh, fun projects. Each model is explained in simple terms, with supportive step-by-step instructions accompanied by intuitively clear diagrams that show each stage of the process. Projects begin with the basics and slowly progress in difficulty, ranging from simple folds (Frog with a Big Mouth, Owlet and Family, Scottie Dog); action folds (Talking Bird, Funky Swan, Somersaulting Frog); and modular folds (Sunburst, Three Wise Men, Chess Set); to trickier projects (Elephant Minor, Angel Fish, Bald Eagle). The authors also provide basic tips on how to fold as the masters do and make projects that come out looking the way you want them to. Whether you're just starting out or you're a confirmed origami enthusiast for life, Origami, Plain and Simple will provide a repertoire of folding feats that's sure to entertain and challenge as it teaches the ins and outs of this captivating art.
