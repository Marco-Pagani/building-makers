# Smart Textiles for Designers: Inventing the Future of Fabrics
## By Rebeccah Pailes-Friedman

Approaches centered on design and designers. Smart Textiles for Designers introduces the different qualities and properties that can be embedded in, integrated with, and applied to fabrics, and looks at the different contexts in which these smart textiles can be used. The first book to look at smart textiles through the eyes of a designer, this is both a core reference work and an inspirational guide for students and professionals alike.
