Paper crafts: a makers guide begins with an overview of various paper styles, sizes, and widths, as well as tools needed for paper crafting.  It then moves on to explore 4 techniques: folding, cutting, sticking, and forming.  Each section starts with an explanation of the history of the technique and includes projects utilizing that technique. There are also plenty of photographs to help you along the way.  Some projects delineated in this book include making a bag out of paper, a paper silhouette, and an origami vase.
