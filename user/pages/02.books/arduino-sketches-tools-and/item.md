<b>Master programming Arduino with this hands-on guide</b> <p><i>Arduino Sketches</i> is a practical guide to programming the increasingly popular microcontroller that brings gadgets to life. Accessible to tech-lovers at any level, this book provides expert instruction on Arduino programming and hands-on practice to test your skills. You'll find coverage of the various Arduino boards, detailed explanations of each standard library, and guidance on creating libraries from scratch – plus practical examples that demonstrate the everyday use of the skills you're learning. Work on increasingly advanced programming projects, and gain more control as you learn about hardware-specific libraries and how to build your own. Take full advantage of the Arduino API, and learn the tips and tricks that will broaden your skillset.</p> <p>The Arduino development board comes with an embedded processor and sockets that allow you to quickly attach peripherals without tools or solders. It's easy to build, easy to program, and requires no specialized hardware. For the hobbyist, it's a dream come true – especially as the popularity of this open-source project inspires even the major tech companies to develop compatible products. <i>Arduino Sketches</i> is a practical, comprehensive guide to getting the most out of your Arduino setup. You'll learn to:</p> <ul> <li>Communicate through Ethernet, WiFi, USB, Firmata, and Xbee</li> <li>Find, import, and update user libraries, and learn to create your own</li> <li>Master the Arduino Due, Esplora, Yun, and Robot boards for enhanced communication, signal-sending, and peripherals</li> <li>Play audio files, send keystrokes to a computer, control LED and cursor movement, and more</li> </ul> <p>This book presents the Arduino fundamentals in a way that helps you apply future additions to the Arduino language, providing a great foundation in this rapidly-growing project. If you're looking to explore Arduino programming, <i>Arduino Sketches</i> is the toolbox you need to get started.</p>
