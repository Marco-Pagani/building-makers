As a "third space" on campus, the library is poised to be the location where researchers and students will come for help with creative endeavors, such as multimedia projects, data visualization, 3D printing and more. Libraries worldwide are coming up with innovative ways to engage students in this dialog, including by setting aside high-tech spaces for creativity. Five models of library creative spaces are explored in this book: digital media labs, Digital Humanities labs, makerspaces, data visualization labs, and knowledge markets. Digital media labs can assist students with audio and video projects for multimodal assignments and their own artistic work. Digital Humanities labs assist faculty and students to envision new scholarship on historical and artistic topics, with librarians and technical staff to instruct and guide them. Makerspaces are problem solving spaces that allow people to tinker, invent, or create 3D models. A visualization lab is a high-tech space used for simulations and data analysis, and may include a visualization wall or other interactive components. A knowledge market is a collaboration between the library (research help), the speech center (presentation skills), the writing center (writing and citation help), along with a data visualization and/or multimedia instruction component. This book explores creative spaces being offered currently in libraries, with a focus on academic libraries. It goes on to give real-world advice for the process of crafting a new space in the library, including finding campus partners, conducting a needs analysis, and answering important questions. Case studies of innovators of library creativity will further highlight the successes-and pitfalls-of embarking on the process of developing a new service or space in the library.
