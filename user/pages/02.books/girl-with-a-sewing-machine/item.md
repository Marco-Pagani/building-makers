The book provides detailed and illustrated instruction on sewing and making one's own clothes. It begins with an overview and detailed list of things that are required for tailoring, such as a sewing kit and fabricology. It includes basic projects like vintage pincushions, scarf tops etc. It advances to somewhat intermediate level projects like customizing clothes with doily details, embroidery, block printing etc. It then provides instructions on making clothes from scratch including how to make dresses, skirts, tops and trousers.
