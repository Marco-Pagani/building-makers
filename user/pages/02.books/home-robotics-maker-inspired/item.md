This book is a treasure trove of robotics projects.  It aims to build your robotics skills as you progress through each set of projects, starting with basic projects and moving to simple robots before finishing with "smart makes" or more complicated robots.  Projects include lists of materials and tools you need, as well as detailed instructions and pictures for each step to guide you through the process.
