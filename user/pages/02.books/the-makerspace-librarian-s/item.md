This book is your go-to guide for starting and running a makerspace in your library.  It includes starter kits and estimated cost for your maker spaces goals (including focus and target users), guides to interactive forms of learning, and how to run your space safely. It then covers the skills makerspace librarians should be familiar with, like Raspberry Pi, 3D Printing, and Robotics.
