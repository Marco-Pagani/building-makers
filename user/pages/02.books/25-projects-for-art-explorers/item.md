### By Christine,Kirker

The book provides instructions on different art projects using a variety of materials and techniques. Each project is presented through an example of a picture book. Children see how it is used in the text. It is then followed by a list of materials required and instructions. The illustrations are imaginative and allow children to think of art as an imaginative and applied process.
