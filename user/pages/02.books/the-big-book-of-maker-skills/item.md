This all encompassing book crams more than 200 small sections into its pages. Each section is a step in developing skills in a specific category (hand tools, power tools, or robotics) and some are projects while others are tips and tricks. By the end of this book, you will have learned to apply an oil finish, fuse metal with a DIY welder, and block your cellphone from satellites.
