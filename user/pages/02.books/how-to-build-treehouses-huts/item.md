There are also forts of every description, including a 21-foot-tall lookout tower modeled on one George Washington built to keep an eye on the redcoats.<br><br>Stiles also adds a design for a snowball catapult, an igloo and even a Nerf-loaded cannon.<br><br>Written for children, with an adult peeking over their shoulder, Stiles's TREEHOUSES, HUTS, & FORTS is a dreamer's handbook, offering practical results.<br>
