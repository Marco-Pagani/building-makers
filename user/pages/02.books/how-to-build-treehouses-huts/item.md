In this delightfully illustrated handbook, David Stiles, the unofficial world grandmaster of the treehouse, shows how.<br><br>Not assuming anything about the treehouse builder, Stiles starts with the basics: how to nail, how to buy wood, what kind of screws and nails to use.<br><br>Then it's on to an A-frame design so simple that it can be built in a weekend out of four sheets of plywood, followed by lean-tos, a tree hut, and a Tarzan-style jungle hideaway. There are also forts of every description, including a 21-foot-tall lookout tower modeled on one George Washington built to keep an eye on the redcoats.<br><br>Stiles also adds a design for a snowball catapult, an igloo and even a Nerf-loaded cannon.<br><br>Written for children, with an adult peeking over their shoulder, Stiles's TREEHOUSES, HUTS, & FORTS is a dreamer's handbook, offering practical results.<br>
