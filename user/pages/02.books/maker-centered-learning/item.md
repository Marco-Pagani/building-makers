This book is dedicated  to answering the leading questions faced by Makers and those who wish to spread knowledge of making, and would be of interest to anyone running or teaching through makerspaces.  The author discusses the ideas leaders and educators in making have about how maker-centered education is shaping the world, under what conditions does maker centered-learning work optimally, and what are the best ways to implement maker centered learning to foster empowerment and deeper thought about the world we live in.
