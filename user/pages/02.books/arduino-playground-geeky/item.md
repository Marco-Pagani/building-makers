<p>You’ve mastered the basics, conquered the soldering iron, and programmed a robot or two; now you’ve got a set of skills and tools to take your Arduino exploits further. But what do you do once you’ve exhausted your to-build list?<br><br><i>Arduino Playground</i> will show you how to keep your hardware hands busy with a variety of intermediate builds, both practical and just-for-fun. Advance your engineering and electronics know-how as you work your way through these 10 complex projects:</p><p><br>*A reaction-time game that leverages the Arduino’s real-time capabilities<br>*A tool for etching your own printed circuit boards<br>*A regulated, variable-voltage power supply<br>*A kinetic wristwatch winder decked out with LEDs<br>*A garage parking assistant that blinks when your vehicle is perfectly parked<br>*A practical and colorful pH meter<br>*A ballistic chronograph that can measure the muzzle velocity of BB, *Airsoft, and pellet guns<br>*A battery saver that prevents accidental discharge<br>*A square-wave generator<br>*A thermometer that tells the temperature using a sequence of colored LEDs<br><br>Each project begins with a list of required tools and components, followed by the instructions, full sketch, and circuit board templates for the build, as well as directions for building a permanent enclosure. You’ll even find the author’s design notes, which are sure to provide inspiration for your own inventions.<br><br>Gather your parts, break out the soldering iron, and get ready to take your Arduino skills to the next level with <i>Arduino Playground</i>.</p><b>Uses the Arduino Nano and Pro Mini boards</b>
